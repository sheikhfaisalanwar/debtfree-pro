## 🎯 Application Overview

DebtFreePro is a React Native application that helps users manage and eliminate debt using proven strategies like the debt snowball method. Key features include:

- ✅ Manual debt entry and management
- ✅ Financial statement upload and processing
- ✅ Debt payoff strategy calculation
- ✅ Progress tracking and analytics
- ✅ Clean domain-driven architecture

## 📊 Current Status

- **Test Coverage**: 96.5% (136 passing / 141 total tests)
- **Architecture**: Clean layered architecture with DDD principles
- **Domain Models**: Fully separated and documented
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API and workflow documentation

## 🏛️ Architecture Highlights

### Domain Model Separation
The application uses a clean domain model with separated concerns:

```
DebtAccount (identity) + DebtBalance (financial data) = Complete debt information
Document (metadata) + FinancialStatement (transactions) = Statement processing
DataStore (unified schema) = Central data management
```

### Service Layer
- **DataStoreService**: Data persistence and retrieval
- **DebtService**: Payoff strategy calculations  
- **DocumentServices**: File upload and processing
- **ValidationServices**: Input validation and sanitization

### Component Architecture
- **Screen Components**: Dashboard, modals, and main views
- **UI Components**: Reusable cards, progress bars, and forms
- **Business Logic**: Separated into focused service classes

## 🔄 Key Workflows

1. **Manual Debt Entry**: User input → Validation → Account + Balance creation → Persistence
2. **Document Processing**: File upload → Parsing → Data extraction → Statement creation
3. **Strategy Calculation**: Debt analysis → Algorithm application → Strategy generation
4. **Progress Tracking**: Data aggregation → Metric calculation → Visualization

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The application employs comprehensive testing:
- **Unit Tests**: Service logic and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Service interactions and data flows  
- **Component Tests**: UI behavior and user interactions
- **Mock Services**: Isolated testing with dependency injection

## 🚀 Getting Started

For development setup:
1. See [Main README](../README.md) for installation instructions
2. Review [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) for system understanding
3. Check [Domain Models](./domain-models.md) for data structure details
4. Explore [API Documentation](./api/) for service usage
