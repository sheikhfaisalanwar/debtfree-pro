## üî• High Priority - Domain Model Refactoring

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design
- [ ] **Analyze Current Model Coupling** 
  - [ ] Map all dependencies between Debt, Statement, and Document models
  - [ ] Identify which fields belong to which domain concepts
  - [ ] Document current data flows and service interactions

- [ ] **Design New Domain Models**
  - [ ] Create `DebtAccount` interface (institution, accountNumber, type, name)
  - [ ] Create `DebtBalance` interface (balance, minimumPayment, interestRate, lastUpdated)
  - [ ] Create `Document` interface (id, fileName, filePath, fileType, uploadDate)
  - [ ] Create `FinancialStatement` interface (statementDate, dueDate, transactions)
  - [ ] Design relationship mappings between entities

### Phase 2: Data Model Implementation
- [ ] **Create New Domain Interfaces**
  - [ ] Implement `DebtAccount.ts`
  - [ ] Implement `DebtBalance.ts` 
  - [ ] Implement `Document.ts`
  - [ ] Implement `FinancialStatement.ts`
  - [ ] Create `DebtAccountBalance` composite interface

- [ ] **Update Data Store Schema**
  - [ ] Design new JSON schema with separated entities
  - [ ] Create migration utilities for existing data
  - [ ] Implement backward compatibility layer
  - [ ] Add schema versioning support

### Phase 3: Service Layer Refactoring
- [ ] **Split DataStoreService Responsibilities**
  - [ ] Create `DebtAccountService` for account management
  - [ ] Create `FinancialDataService` for balance/statement operations
  - [ ] Create `DocumentService` for file operations
  - [ ] Update `DataStoreService` to coordinate between services

- [ ] **Refactor Business Logic Services**
  - [ ] Update `StatementProcessingService` to work with new models
  - [ ] Refactor `DocumentManagerService` to separate concerns
  - [ ] Update `DebtService` to use separated account/balance models

### Phase 4: Component Updates
- [ ] **Update Modal Components**
  - [ ] Refactor `ManualDebtEntryModal` to create account + balance
  - [ ] Update `EditDebtModal` to handle separated models
  - [ ] Ensure proper data binding with new interfaces

- [ ] **Update Display Components**
  - [ ] Modify `DebtCard` to work with composite data
  - [ ] Update Dashboard to aggregate account + balance data
  - [ ] Ensure proper data loading and state management

### Phase 5: Testing and Migration
- [ ] **Update Test Suite**
  - [ ] Refactor unit tests for new service interfaces
  - [ ] Update integration tests for new data flows
  - [ ] Add migration testing for existing data
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility testing

- [ ] **Data Migration**
  - [ ] Implement automatic migration on app startup
  - [ ] Handle edge cases and validation errors
  - [ ] Add rollback capabilities for failed migrations
  - [ ] Test migration with real user data scenarios

## üöÄ Post-Refactoring Features

### Settings and Configuration
- [ ] **Settings Screen Implementation**
  - [ ] Create SettingsScreen component
  - [ ] Add extra payment configuration
  - [ ] Implement strategy selection (Snowball/Avalanche)
  - [ ] Currency and formatting preferences

### Enhanced Statement Processing
- [ ] **Statement Review UI**
  - [ ] Create StatementReviewScreen for editing parsed transactions
  - [ ] Add transaction categorization interface
  - [ ] Implement manual transaction editing
  - [ ] Add bulk transaction operations

### Data Visualization
- [ ] **Charts and Analytics**
  - [ ] Implement debt progress charts
  - [ ] Add payment history visualization
  - [ ] Create spending category breakdowns
  - [ ] Add payoff projection graphs

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Payment Reminders**
  - [ ] Implement local notification system
  - [ ] Add due date tracking and alerts
  - [ ] Create payment scheduling interface

- [ ] **Export and Backup**
  - [ ] PDF report generation
  - [ ] CSV export functionality
  - [ ] Cloud backup integration options

## üî¨ Technical Debt and Improvements

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Profile app performance with large datasets
  - [ ] Optimize JSON operations for better speed
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for large statement lists

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Standardize error handling patterns across services
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error boundary components
  - [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for file operations

### Testing Improvements
- [ ] **Enhanced Test Coverage**
  - [ ] Add end-to-end testing with Detox
  - [ ] Implement visual regression testing
  - [ ] Add property-based testing for financial calculations

- [ ] **Test Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Set up continuous integration pipeline
  - [ ] Add automated testing on PRs
  - [ ] Implement test data factories

## üéØ Long-term Goals

### Multi-Strategy Support
- [ ] **Debt Avalanche Implementation**
  - [ ] Add avalanche calculation logic
  - [ ] Update UI to support strategy switching
  - [ ] Compare strategies side-by-side

### Advanced Analytics
- [ ] **Spending Insights**
  - [ ] Machine learning for spending categorization
  - [ ] Trend analysis and predictions
  - [ ] Personalized recommendations

### Platform Expansion
- [ ] **Web Version**
  - [ ] React web application with shared business logic
  - [ ] Responsive design for desktop/tablet
  - [ ] Data synchronization between platforms

## üìù Notes

### Dependencies Between Tasks
- Domain model refactoring must be completed before any major feature additions
- Settings screen depends on new data model structure
- Advanced analytics require stable data relationships

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Keep comprehensive test coverage throughout changes

### Success Metrics
- Reduced coupling between domain models
- Improved code maintainability scores
- Faster development velocity for new features
- Zero data loss during model migration
